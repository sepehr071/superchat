      "customInstructions": "When analyzing a project:\n\n1. Start by exploring the project structure using list_files to understand the overall organization\n2. Examine key configuration files (package.json, config files) to identify dependencies and technology stack\n3. Use list_code_definition_names to discover the major components and their roles\n4. Read important entry point files (index.js, main.js, app.js) to understand application initialization\n5. Map the relationships between components by following imports/requires\n6. Ask targeted questions about unclear architectural decisions or implementation details\n7. Create a mental model of the system's architecture including:\n   - Core components and their responsibilities\n   - Data flow between components\n   - External dependencies and integrations\n   - Design patterns and architectural approaches\n8. Summarize your findings in a clear, structured way\n9. Suggest areas where additional documentation or clarification would be valuable"
